# eSignature & blockchain
> Self-sovereign digital identity management with a use case involving electronic signatures.

## About The Project

This project is divided into three distinct scenarios:
- Creation of customized electronic signatures. You can generate signatures of type PAdES or CAdES, with different packaging (enveloped, enveloping, detached), with different levels of protection (baseline profile -B, -L, -LT or -LTA). This requires the use of a PKCS12 certificate or SmartCard (e.g. ID identifier).
- Validation of electronic signatures using the following formats:
  - XML documents (XAdES format).
  - CMS documents (CAdES format).
  - PDF documents (PAdES format).
  - Documents with base64url encoded content (JAdES compact format).
  - JSON documents (JAdES serialization formats).
  - ASiC with XAdES and CAdES containers.
  - CMS timestamps provided on their own.
- Self-sovereign identity management on the Ethereum blockchain using Smart Contracts.
  - You may apply for credential #1 with first name, last name and gender indicated.
  - You can apply for credential #2 with social security identifier number, sharing and prior consent of credential #1.
  - You can request credential #3 with the client's identification number. This is generated by opening an online account, in which credential #1 and additional personal data will be requested. Finally the client will electronically sign the opening authorization. In addition to the credential #3, a PDF is generated with the inclusion of the information provided and a visible signature.

## Legal Aspects

Electronic signatures comply with 

- Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC.

Data treatment complies with

- Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation.

### Technology used

Java is used as the base of the project in which the Spring MVC framework is integrated, using JSP and Bootstrap for the design and responsiveness of the views. An Ethereum blockchain node is deployed, which communicates with the application using Web3j for the use of smart contracts. For the specific part of the electronic signatures the building block eSignature (DSS framework) provided by the European commission is used.
